# Chord Diagram Database

This page established with huge help by the following awesome github project [https://github.com/T-vK/chord-collection](https://github.com/T-vK/chord-collection). but why? because a simple chords with only one variation take about 1.3 Mb file size of chords.js and a complete with approxmiately 4 variations each chord could take about 13.5Mb. with that in mind, it's not a good idea to serve this JS file in a website (imagine how long would it take to load that JS file with just a cheap web server, like mine ðŸ˜¢).

## Want to hosted on your own webserver?

if you need a complete chords to be hosted in your own website, then please copy **chords/** directory and paste it somewhere else in your web server.

BTW, this is my website [KORDS.id](https://kords.id)
