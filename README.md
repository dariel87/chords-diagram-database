# Chord Diagram Database

This page established with huge help by the following awesome github project [/T-vK/chord-collection](https://github.com/T-vK/chord-collection). but why? because a simple chords with only one variation take about 1.3 Mb file size of chords.js and a complete with approxmiately 4 variations each chord could take about 13.5Mb. with that in mind, it's not a good idea to serve this JS file in a website.

## Want to hosted on your own webserver?

if you need a complete chords to be hosted in your own website, then please copy **chords/** directory and paste it somewhere else in your web server.

## Note on filenaming

To prevent error in most webserver, chord with slash (compound) and hash (sharp) will be translated into _ and __ respectively. for example C/A will be C_A.png, C/A# will be C_A__.png and so on.
